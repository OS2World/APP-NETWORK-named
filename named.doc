A simple name server for OS/2
=============================

Introduction
------------
This package contains a very simple domain name server for OS/2.  It is
intended primarily for small networks which access the Internet via a
dialup connection (where another, real name server will also be used). 

The name database is, simply, the HOSTS file normally used by the OS/2
name resolution library.  However, if the dialup connection is active,
then another name server (typically that at the ISP) can be consulted as
well. 

There are other, more sophisticated, name server programs available;
this one is, however, small, fast and free!

How does name resolution work?
------------------------------
Normally, OS/2 does name resolution by consulting a set of name servers
(specified via the RESOLV2 file) and/or by looking at a static list of
hosts in the HOSTS file.  By default, the name server is consulted
first, but this means that a different RESOLV2 file is needed when the
dialup connection is not active.  This search order can be overridden by
putting:

          SET USE_HOSTS_FIRST=1

in CONFIG.SYS, but it is more convenient to use a small local server
that can pass on queries to another name server if it is available. 
This eliminates tiresome delays waiting for timeouts. 

Setting up the server
=====================
Installation and setting up of the server is very easy.

Step 1
------
Copy the program files into place.  Copy NAMED.EXE to any suitable
directory; it is convenient if this directory is on the PATH.  Also,
copy NETLIB.DLL to a directory that is on the LIBPATH. 

Step 2
------
Locate the ETC directory used by TCP/IP.  If you don't know the location
of this directory, type the command:

          SET ETC

at an OS/2 command prompt.  You need to create one file in this
directory.  We'll call this the ETC directory from now on. 

Step 3
------
Create the NAMED configuration file.  This must be called NAMED.CNF, and
must reside in the ETC directory. 

The format of the configuration file is very simple.  Items within lines
are separated by any number of space or tab characters (as long as there
is at least one).  Anything on a line after (and including) a '#'
character is ignored.  Each line starts with a command, followed by
parameters which depend on the command.  Commands are as below: items in <>
indicate values to be inserted. Commands don't have to be in upper case.

PORT    <portnumber>
	This indicates the port on which NAMED should listen. Normally, this
	command can be omitted, and the default DNS port number derived from
	the SERVICES file in the ETC directory will be used.

AUTH_NETWORK   <network-ip-address>
	Specifies the IP address (as a dotted quad) of the local network,
	for which the name server is to provide answers. This is used
	for seeing if answers can be provided for reverse lookups.
	It is used in conjunction with AUTH_NETMASK (see below).

AUTH_NETMASK   <network-mask>
	This mask (expressed as a dotted quad) is used to mask IP addresses
	which are the subject of reverse lookups, before seeing if they
	match the network address given by AUTH_NETWORK. In most cases,
	where a class C network is being used, the last number in
	AUTH_NETWORK is zero, and AUTH_NETMASK is 255.255.255.0 so that
	only the network part is compared.

AUTH_DOMAIN   <domain-name>
	This gives the domain for which the DNS gives its own authoritative
	answers; use the domain for your local network. This will be the same
	as the one in your RESOLV2 file.

REFER_INTERFACE    <interface-name>
	This gives the name of the dialup interface (e.g. sl0 for SLIP).
	If this interface exists and is marked as UP, then names that
	cannot be resolved locally will be passed on to the name server
	provided by the 'other' end of this interface.

REFER_SERVERS     <network-ip> <network-mask> <name-server1> <name-server2>
	This is a bit complicated. It handles the fact that the dialup
	may not always be to the same ISP, and for each ISP there will be
	different name server addresses.
	The 'network-ip' is the network address of the ISP; essentially, as
	much as possible of any IP address that will be handed out as a
	dynamic IP address. The 'network-mask' is used to mask the actual
	address of the 'refer interface'; if the masked value matches the
	'network-ip', then the name servers given on the rest of the line
	are consulted in turn. There may be as many as desired although only
	two are shown above. If the values don't match, none of the specified
	name servers are consulted.
	This configuration statement can appear more than once, and each is
	tried in turn until there is a match for 'network-ip'.

A sample NAMED.CNF is included with the package.  This MUST NOT be used
in its current form; edit to suit your local environment.

Step 5
------
Start the server. The easiest way is to issue the command:

	START "Name Server" /MIN /N NAMED

This starts the program minimised, in a VIO window, and it will appear in the
Window List with a meaningful name.

To start the server automatically at every boot, add the above command
to the \TCPIP\BIN\TCPEXIT.CMD file.  If that file doesn't exist, create
it, containing just the above line. 

Logging
-------
The server maintains a logfile in the ETC directory, under the name
NAMED.LOG.  This file will grow without bound unless regularly pruned;
its use is really limited to debugging.  It could be deleted or renamed
in TCPEXIT.CMD, just before starting the program. 

That's all there is to starting the server.
